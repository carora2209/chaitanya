  <h2><strong>Why is it caused ?</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>Apple scab is a common disease of plants in the rose family (Rosaceae) that is caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis.</strong></h3>
  <h2><strong>Cure:</strong></h2>
  <h3><strong>The first symptoms of this disease are found in the foliage, blossoms, and developing fruits of affected trees, which develop dark, irregularly-shaped lesions upon infection.Although apple scab rarely kills its host, infection typically leads to fruit deformation and premature leaf and fruit drop, which enhance the susceptibility of the host plant to abiotic stress and secondary infection.</strong></h3>
